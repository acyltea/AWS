#This is a simple exercise for setting up the command line for AWS.

#First we have to do the actual cli setup for our OS. I'm using a macOS, so here is the documentation:
#https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html

#After we download the package and run through the installation windows we have to verify the installation is correct.
#We use the following commands:

$ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws <- output example 
$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.1.24 Python/3.7.4 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.0.0 <-output example

#But we're not off the races just yet. Since I want to be able to make changes on an existing AWS account, 
#I should configure the AWS cli in order to be able to login.  
#As a best practice, I should never login as the root user and should create an 'Administrator' user profile instead. 
#The following documentation shows you how to do this:
#https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html

#Now that everything is set up, and my credentials are saved somewhere safe, I'm going to run through some commands:

aws s3 ls <- this lists buckets that currently exist on your account
aws s3 mb <bucketname> <- this creates an S3 bucket
Aws s3 cp /path/to/file.txt.s3://bucketname <-this copies a simple file or document from my machine to my new bucket

#If you don't have an AWS account and need to create one, start here:
