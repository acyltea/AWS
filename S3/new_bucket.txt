The following is a simple recipe for creating and uploading a file to an S3 bucket:

1. Create a new bucket via the Management Console dashboard (accessible with a web browser).

2. Use either the dashboard or the AWS CLI (accessible via the command line terminal: 
aws s3 cp mylocalfile.txt s3://mybucketname/) to upload one or more files.

3. Give public read access to the object.

4. From the file's Overview page in the S3 dashboard, copy its public link.

5. Paste the link into the URL field of a broswer that's not logged into AWS. 

6. Confirm that you can open the file!
